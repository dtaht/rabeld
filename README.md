RABEL - rapid, reliable updates for the babel protocol daemon
====

I have been carrying an increasing number of ad-hoc patches for babel
and trying to gain the time to tackle some of the really hard problems,
across a large testbed of very disparate machines, needing custom builds
on each.

Finding a place to stick the rubble (I was going to call this repo
rubble rather than rabble) makes sense given the size of the network
and the chaos induced by all the different patches under test.

For thoughts as to enhancements and experiments in the queue for rabel, see:
[rabel.md](/rabel.md).

For more details on the babel routing protocol, see the main
README.
